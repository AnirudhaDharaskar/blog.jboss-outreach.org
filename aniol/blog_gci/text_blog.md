<h2>Problems</h2>
This year I decided to participate in Google Code-In (https://codein.withgoogle.com/).
Google Code-In is a site where they give you work to do and you do them, a type of open source project.
Days before I was already preparing to do this type of projects, I was observing for days the different amount of organizers that there was and the diversity of programming languages.
I was very familiar with HTML, CSS and JS, since they were the languages ​​I knew most.
JBoss Community had not taken it as an option, but at the beginning I saw that their projects were easy and very helpful to understand. They fulfilled everything I needed and in the end I got involved with that organizer.
The first job / project I chose was an easy one since at that time I did not have much time but now I am more willing to do more difficult jobs.

<h2>Decide</h2>
It cost me a lot to choose in so many variety of projects from so many different organizations.
He would pick one and after two minutes he would find another one more interesting and leave it. Until I found one that interested me a lot "CSS Animation", because as I said before this is a language that is very much.
I finished doing the animation and I uploaded it to github, I did not know how it worked, and I gave it to submit.
After half a day they told me that I had to upload it in the jboss folder, and create a pull request, at that time I did not know it was a pull request.
I searched and asked until I understood what I had to do and I finally got it accepted at this time, my self-esteem went up and I continued doing work and nothing stopped me.

<h2> Give up.</h2>
Even if they tell you do not give up, if you can not do it, do not do it. As these sentences say: The knowledge of man can not go beyond his experience.

<h2>Don’t be scared of starting again.</h2>

And if it does not come out, start again no one will tell you anything to start over
