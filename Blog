                                             My Experience with GCI
Hi, I am Anirudha. I am glad that I was lucky enough to know about GCI. Actually, I got to know of it, from my momâ€™s friend. 
Her son I think probably is studying in IIT Ghuwati. When I registered in the competition, I was in a state of wonder, amazement
and awe. There were so many tasks to do. I remember, the first task I had completed had many problems but the mentors were very
helpful and helped me to handle the situation. I think the interface has to be friendlier by telling the participants the process
of the competition in a simple way. On the other side, I got know about various knew things such as Github, Gitlab, Haiku and Libral
Health. I had enjoyed completing the tasks. I am thankful full to Google for giving me a chance to let me show my passion.
