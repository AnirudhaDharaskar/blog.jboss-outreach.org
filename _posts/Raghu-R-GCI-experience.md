## Google Code-In
Google Code-in is a competitive event organised by Google which exposes young and budding developers to open source organisations, in a task based environment. In this way, they learn different ways to solve real life problems for open source organisations. This gives people much needed experience that they will require to deal with situations they make face durind the ir jobs or ather later ventures. Famous open source organisations like Ubuntu, Wikimedia, and Apertium have come together to create tasks that will help the participants, and the open source organisations that are helping in this event.

## What I've Learned
This is the first time I'm participating in Google code in 2017, and so far it has been a fruitful experience. I learned about Musicbrainz, a music metadata wiki, and the Metabrainz foundation which maintains it. I have learned about the JBoss Outreach organization, which has made some interesting projects like a facebook meme generator bot. Now I know how to use an IRC client, and it has been very helpful for communicating with different organizations, and receiving feedback about my work. One really good thing about Google Code-In is that there are mentors, who will be there to tell you if you're doing something wrong. I have learned to present my work correctly, and use various tools in the process. Even in the process of writing this blog post, I have learned how to use Jekyll to generate blog posts and use markdown to format them.

My have learned a lot and understood how my skills are applicable in the real world due to Google Code-In 2017. I'd like to thank Google for giving me this opportunity to learn things by solving my own problems, and other's problems.
I hope to increase the depth of my knowledge, and improve my existing skillset using competitions and creative contests like Google Code-In!
