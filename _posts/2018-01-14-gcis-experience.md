## Introduction
I am Lokshiv Gupta from Jalandhar, India studying in 8th grade. I am a beginner in the field of Computer Science. I am currently working on web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## My Experience
This is the first time I am participating in a competition organised by Google and I am trying to work on as many tasks as possible. One thing that I learned is that accuracy is more important than quantity. Writing efficient code is always more important than writing more code.

I really enjoyed working on the problems and spending time to learn new things. In the future, I would definitely like to participate in Google Code - In, as well as other contests organised by Google.

**Kudos to the Google Code - In team!**
