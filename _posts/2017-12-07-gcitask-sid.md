This is my first GCI. I'm a teen from India who is a **Graphics Designer**. I got to know about this competition from my schoolmates. It's been about 10 days and I've completed around 10 tasks. I'd a pretty slow start but then I caught up my pace. The real difficulty with this competition is that it's around the time of my examinations. It's a quite tough task to do both GCI & exams and sometimes the time **"equilibrium"** for both is not maintained. My biggest fear in this event is to abandon a task and feel gloomy about it. Right now I'm completing all the **"User interface"** tasks and some basic coding tasks as well. The overall spirit amongst us is high and I hope I get the chance to achieve something huge in my life !


## What have I gained ?

* The GCI t-shirt (jk)
* Experience about professionalism
* The experience of meeting fellow participants around the globe
* The mentorship given by our great mentors
* The chance to see where I stand amongst others


I hope my contributions to **Open Source** would help this community.
