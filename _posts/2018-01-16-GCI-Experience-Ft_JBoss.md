Introduction

Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Zixin, an enthusiastic 17 year old from Singapore at Google Code-In! When I first encountered coding and interacted with Python, I was explicably drawn to its ability to not only solve problems, but more importantly link ideas from the creator to the computer and actually create something unique. 
It was magic. 
It intrigued me more than all my other subjects and I have since embarked on various projects, hackathons, and involved myself in conferences and helping the community. Thus I am participating in GCI 2017-18 to do all of the above and expand my interests and expertise in programming and open source projects.

Experience

It was a very interesting and humbling experience to be able to contribute to such large scale open source projects and be guided by mentors along the way. At first glances the task seemed daunting but I started with easier ones like building and running a local node server hosted by JBoss - which was surprisingly well documented for a task with alright difficulty! 

The mentors at JBoss are friendly and quick to respond and the experience of GCI was a great one. :) I would definitely recommend my juniors to participate and learn skills like forking a repository, hosting a local node server, and submitting your own bug fixes to a software open source code! :)
