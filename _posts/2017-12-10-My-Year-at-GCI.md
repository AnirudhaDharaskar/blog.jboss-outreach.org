*This will be my first year participating in Google Code-In.*

*Like many other students, I am extremely excited to work on open-source tasks for various organizations. Having been a part of several open-source activities previously, I've learnt plenty from my past experiences. I believe that Google Code-In will be no exception.*

Fast forward several weeks and over a dozen tasks, I'm glad to have taken part in this competition.

I originally expected to bolster my knowledge and skills in various languages and fields of software development. What I have learnt has gone beyond my expectations.

Google Code-In has provided me with the platform to meet students all over the world and have a stake in various wonderful organizations.

This has been my first, and unfortunately my last year participating in Google Code-In. I'm really grateful to the organization JBoss for their efforts and patience (this is their first year in GCI!), my fellow students who have been really friendly and Google for giving all of us this opportunity.
