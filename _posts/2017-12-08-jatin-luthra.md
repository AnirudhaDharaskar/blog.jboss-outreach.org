## Introduction

I am **Jatin Luthra**, a **Passionate Coder** from India. This is my Third GCI. Few years back, I attended a seminar in my school which was conducted by a Google Employee from the school's Alumni.
Upset from last GCI, I made a knot that **Quality >> Quantity**. This is the reason that I stopped counting my tasks and started looking forward to What I am submitting.

## Difficulties

The only difficulty I faced is that It is my Class 12 which means my final Board class. So balancing was difficult but I am trying to give my 100% to both.

I generally do **Coding** and **Documentation** tasks. The main reason is that I can contribute to community and help others too by documenting.

## Things Acheived

* More Experience
* Attention and help from the Mentors (A Lot!)
* Helping others as I go on
* Improvement in my Coding with the help of Mentors
* Motivation and Appreciation from all.

## Conclusion

I Hope that I can provide my best to this **JBoss community** and the **Open Source World**.
