# Introduction

So first, before sharing my experience, let me introduce you to Google-Code In. So, Google Code-In is an annual contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. Since 2010, over 4500 students from 99 countries have completed work in the contest and this number is increasing every year. 


The quality of tasks given to the students during the entire event is quite appropriate. The level of tasks keep increasing gradually. There are tasks for everybody, along with the coding tasks, there are documentation, outreach, user interface tasks as well.

# My Experience

This was my first year participating in Code-In, during the entire event, I decided to work for the **JBoss Community** and I have totally loved the experience. This event has introduced to me proper Open Source Software development, I am amazed by seeing so many people come up and contribute to different projects. 


The tasks offered to us by the JBoss Community were more focused on giving us the learning curve and introduce us to new technologies, I found them to be very interesting.


**So now, let me walk you through how my one and a half month went:**


It's 10th of December, it's the dreaded last happy day before the start of my Term 2 (semester end) exams. I wake up, get freshened and open my laptop. Now this may seem confusing to my classmates who would think that I am passing my time just one day before the start of my exams. But little do they know that I am in an environment which would teach me lots and lots of new things which would help me in the future. 


Fast forward to 6 days, the next day I have my math exam and I am still on my laptop, I hear my mother shouting "kal maths exam hai, laptop band karo aur padhne baith jao" ("you have your math exam tomorrow, shut down your laptop and go study") at that point of time, my mind thinks to obey what my mother just said, but my heart, disagreeing to this thought, being so addicted to this beautiful environment, refuses to leave it.
Working in this environment became a habit for me, I remember one incident, during my Computer Sciences exam, I finished it before the time limit and had around 20mins to spare. I took an extra sheet and utilised my time by making mockup icon for the compressor head android app (which was one of the tasks)


This is what a magnificent platform like Google Code In does to you. It makes you feel that excitement, makes you crave for that notification which says **"Your Task got approved by your mentor"**. It makes you beat the competition and come on top. I can't even describe that feeling which I got when I saw my name on the leaderboard, it was just amazing.

I tried to balance the number of tasks I did with their categories. Initially as I was not properly accustomed to the technologies required but with time, tried to grasp them and how they worked. Inspired by this, I made an unofficial moto for Google Code in which wash **“Learn what you fear”**


During the course of this event, I worked multiple JBoss projects like Lead Management Android app which is an app for the businesses to manage their potential leads and increase their productivity. The certifier project which would allow any organisation head to generate certificates of any event, the compressor head android app which lets user compress images before downloading them. I also helped build our official website for GCI 2017. I enjoyed a lot in contributing to these.  


One of the main objectives of this event is to make you **connect** with the online open source community and I feel that this is easily the best part about it. There were participants from all around the globe, I made a lot of friends, throughout the event, we helped each other, sometimes talked about how each of our countries differed from each other from giving school holidays :P to even the cultures. All of the mentors at my  Even the mentors were very friendly to us. They helped us however small the problem was. Sometimes, they also asked us about our school lives and how we can improve ourselves to become better in the future. So, socialising with others was definitely the best *value* which I learnt.


The second thing I learnt was to **never give up** on trying until you get what you want. Earlier, I found some tasks to be difficult and feared them, but later I learned how not to fear them and then I started to intentionally take up those tasks and took time to learn about them. This principle, I also started applying in my day to day life and it helped me a lot


I am writing this with just 2 days to go before this event ends and it feels like it just started yesterday. I am already feeling **nostalgic** and sad that this amazing experience is going to end. During the course of this event, open source has influenced me a lot, I will definitely continue to make more and more contributions to The JBoss Community and rest of the open source world.


I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with the JBoss Community. Everything about it, the mentors, the participating students is just amazing, there is definitely a special bond which exists between us. :) 


So, before ending this blog, I would like to thank all the mentors who gave their best in helping us. Also, a big thanks to Google for providing such an amazing platform to us youngsters, A huge round of applause for everyone including the students for making this event a suceess!


Wrapping it up,  I would say that this one and a half month were the best I could have utilised in 2017 and in the start of 2018. :) 


Thank You
