I anxiously waited for the event to start. It had been quite some time of constant refreshing of the JBoss event page where one could only login and join the discussion 15 minutes before the event started. I was full of curiosity. It was going to my first developer event.

Soon, a notice popped up -  `the Event is about to begin, please wait a few minutes`. That really got my heart racing! I realize that it is a trivial thing to be excited about, but I just could not stop myself!

Soon enough, the webinar, `Virtualization as a path to an optimized, modern datacenter` started. The presenters were full of enthusiasm and I could tell that they knew everything there was to know within the subject. I was a little fazed in the beginning of the webinar, since this was actually the second conference in a series of 3. It did not help that the volume was a little low and microphone not so clear in the beginning. However, I asked a few questions, and the presenters were extremely helpful in their answers.

I attended the webinar with very little knowledge of what Virtualization actually meant. I learnt that it optimized digital transmission, was at the peak of innovation in this modern era, and increased the competitive capability of any company. It essentially modernizes infrastructure and applications, and is a key enabler in helping us on our digital transmission journey. As the presenter explained to me in relatively simple words, virtualization means to create a virtual version of a device or resource, like a server or a network where the framework divides the resource into one or more execution environments.

Most people actually think virtualization is being adopted everywhere and this period has now rolled over, but in reality, this is not the case at all. RedHat conducted surveys where they found out that virtualization is actually on the rise! In fact, it is expected to rise by over 20% in deployment over the next 2 years.

RedHat is at the forefront of virtualization, and the fact that the Director of Project Management actually spoke for the majority of the time gave me a very good impression of the company.

I learnt a lot about virtualization today, which reduces infrastructure costs and improves performance too, among other benefits. I was also introduced to a plethora of new architectures, and to the steps to actually implement RedHatâ€™s program.

My first developer conference was as awesome and informative as I expected it to be. It was a great experience, and I look forward to attending another event soon!
