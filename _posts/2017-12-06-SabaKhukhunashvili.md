# {What is Google Code-In}

Google Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development.
Open source organizations (chosen by Google) provide students with a list of tasks for which pupils work for 7 weeks.All organizations have the mentors who are assisting in the task.

## {Types of tasks}

Tasks are categorized as: Code, Documentation/Training, Outreach/Research, Quality Assurance and User Interface. Students can claim and work on the task that interests them. They are provided anything between 3 to 7 days for its completion. Once the student feels their work is ready, they submit their work for review through the contest website. Mentors from the organization evaluate the work, provide feedback, and if it's complete, approve it! Otherwise, specific important feedback is provided, and the student updates the work. Once a task is accepted, the student can claim another!

## {Prizes}
There is no such thing as a Google contest without Prizes, Google Code-In is not exception too. 
You get an assured digital certificate, if you complete 1 task you can even earn a google tshirt if you complete 3 tasks. :D 
At the end of the contest, five finalists are chosen to get hoodies and two of them are chosen to be the grand prize winners and earn themselves a trip to Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California!
The more tasks you do, with creativity and quality, the better chance you have to win the mega prize

## {Why you should take part in it?}
Google code in aims to inculcate values of teamwork in the students. You even get a chance to, make friends from different countries around the world and most importantly get great experience. Prizes are definitely Google’s way to thank you for your hardwork. :D

# { My Google Code-In Experience }
Three weeks have passed since the start of Google's event. as for the organization I chose the Jboss  Community by Redhat, because I was  familiar with the technologies and programming languages that were required to be a part of it. As of now, most of my  tasks are related to Android. Daily group work with foreigners has given me great experience in communication, writing clean code & version control.The mentors and even the participating students are very helpful, I have learned a lot from them.
During this time, we have created an Android Library, several applications and sites.  Two weeks after the start of the event, when I saw my organization's page, I found a list of leaders where my name was written, this motivated me to do more and more stuff and cause my parents to be proud of me. :) I want to win and I will do everything for it but the competition is huge and even if I don’t win, I’ll be happy in being a part of the leader list. I. made a great decision by joining Google Code-In and i advise you to participate in Google Code-In and try your fate between 6500 pupils. ;)
